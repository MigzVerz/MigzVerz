## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Miguel I am from Brasil, and trying to became a full stack developer.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, Python and other languages, also trying to start to code some begginer projects by my self. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything for begginers so I can learn how to use github properly.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with some tips on begginer friendly projects to do on my own.
